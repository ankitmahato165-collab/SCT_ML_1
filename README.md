Project Title
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

🔍 Project Description
This project is part of my Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The goal of this task is to implement a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on important features such as:
Square Footage
Number of Bedrooms
Number of Bathrooms
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to model the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
Feature
Description
sqft
Area of the house in square feet
bedrooms
Number of bedrooms
bathrooms
Number of bathrooms
price
House price (target variable)

⚙️ Implementation Steps
Imported required Python libraries
Loaded and explored the dataset
Performed data preprocessing
Selected features and target variable
Trained a Linear Regression model
Predicted house prices
Evaluated model performance
